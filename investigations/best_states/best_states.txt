The process for determining states with the highest quality care is very similar to the process conducted to determine hospitals with the highest quality care. Like the previous analysis, the mean of the scores is 0 with a standard deviation of 1:

WI	0.64
SD	0.6
ME	0.59
VT	0.58
LA	0.55
IN	0.5
KS	0.46
MN	0.43
SC	0.43
AL	0.42

One thing to note is that scores are not as far from the mean as was previously. This is because state scores were calculating by taking the average of all hospitals in that state, then compared against the mean and standard deviation. Because the survey responses score, base score, and consistency scores for each state is already an aggregated score, a lot of the outliers are flattened out and don't create as many scores that are any more than 0.64 standard deviations away from the mean.
